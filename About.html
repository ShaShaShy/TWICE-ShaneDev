		On November 4, 2015 - Twice released their official fandom name through their official instagram account. The girls posted a photo above to Instagram as well as the message, "A lot of fans liked 'Once,' 'Once and TWICE.' Once then TWICE. They seem to go together. If you love us even once, we'll repay you with TWICE our love. It's difficult to connect with people, and getting people to love is the most difficult of all. We'll work hard so that you can look at us once, and fall in love with us TWICE. Be with us until the end. We love you. <3."
